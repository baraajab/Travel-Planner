## üåç Overview <a name = "overview"></a>

This section outlines the different stages of the Udacity Travel App web development:

1. **Planning & Design:** The first phase involves defining the project's scope, identifying the required features, and deciding on the visual layout. During this phase, wireframes and mockups are developed to plan the UI/UX design.

2. **Front-End Development:** In this stage, the visual and interactive aspects of the application are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end libraries and frameworks are used to improve the functionality and appearance of the app.

3. **Back-End Development:** The back-end involves creating the server-side infrastructure to handle user requests, manage data, and implement business logic. Technologies like Node.js or Django are commonly used for this purpose.

4. **API Integration:** The app pulls data from external APIs, such as travel services, weather data, and maps, to provide users with real-time travel information like flight schedules, hotel availability, and weather updates.

5. **Security & Authentication:** Secure user authentication and data protection are essential. Features like login, sign-up, password management, and data encryption ensure users' information is safe.

6. **Testing & Debugging:** As the project progresses, regular testing is carried out to ensure everything works correctly. Techniques like unit and integration testing are employed to detect and resolve bugs.

7. **Deployment:** After all components are integrated and tested, the app is deployed to a live server, making it accessible to users. This includes setting up the necessary hosting and databases.

8. **Ongoing Maintenance:** Once deployed, the app requires periodic updates and performance checks. This phase focuses on ensuring the application remains functional and incorporating user feedback for improvements.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions <a name = "setup_instructions"></a>

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### Prerequisites:

- **Web Browser:** A modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge is required to test the app.
- **Text Editor/IDE:** Use an editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm to write and edit code.
- **Node.js:** Install Node.js if the project uses server-side JavaScript. Visit the official Node.js website for installation instructions.
- **Package Manager:** Ensure you have npm (or Yarn) to handle project dependencies.

### Installation Steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Create an `.env` file with updated credentials and environment variable names. For instance, use `USERNAME1` instead of `USERNAME`, and ensure this change is reflected in the server file.
3. Obtain keys for services like weather APIs and other necessary credentials, then add them to the `.env` file.
